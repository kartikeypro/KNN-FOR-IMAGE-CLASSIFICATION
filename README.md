# KNN-FOR-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
Although the file also contains the code for image classification using Perceptron and Neural network, I have specifically named it KNN classifier as SKLEARN implementaion of KNN dosen't allow 3-D inputs. In order to address that issue I have implemented KNN which will allow you to process GRAYSCALE images through it, wherein the dimension of parameter is (IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH, NO OF EXAMPLES). You don't need to iterate over each example you can just input the training set in the given manner. It might work well for small dataset. I have not tried for large dataset but I'll let you guyz know once I check that too. And I would highly recommend you to use it in class assignments as I can gladly say that my code is bit amateur. Your professor won't detect any foul play unless you and me belong to the same college :))))
